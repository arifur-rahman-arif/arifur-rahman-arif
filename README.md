### A brief talk about me:

I have been working in the web development sector for about 3 years.
Worked with clients & companies from home country to abroad. What I understood, that to thrive in this sector I don't only need to be good
at what I'm doing, but I have to be the best. Because people tends to choose best thing for their need, good is not enough.
Following that motto, I try to improve & update myself each & every day to deliver the best at what I'm doing.
